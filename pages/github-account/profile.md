## Go to your profile to share with others

A profile page is automatically created for your Github account, where you and others can see your activities on Github.

The URL is always `https://github.com/Accountname`

You can reach your own profile by clicking on your profile picture in the upper right corner and then on `Your Profile`

There you also have the possibility to upload a profile picture. That makes the world more colorful ;)
