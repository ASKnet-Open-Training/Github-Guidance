# Save a file in a repository (commit)
To edit a Markdown file like a readme you should have a look at the syntax of [Markdown](github-markdown). Because you can create headings, list items, links and more to make your text clearer. Markdown is a very simple format and is used in more and more areas like wikis or issuesystems.

In Git systems it is necessary to leave a small message (commit message) of what or why you made a change (commit). You can leave a <span style="color:red;">title (required)</span> and a <span style="color:blue;">description</span> for a <span style="color:green;">commit</span>. The <span style="color:blue;">description</span> is only needed if the <span style="color:red;">title</span> is not sufficient. But a meaningful title would be great!
