# Check if repository is complete
Github provides a check if the repository contains all important files.

1. Click on `insights` and it brings the page bellow.

![Git repo commit]({{ 'assets/images/github-repo-checkup.jpg' | relative_url }})


2. Check for the field of interest f

For example if its license add and select the open source license of your choice.
But for the sake of the above one its already marked ,meaning the repository has the license already.

![Git repo commit]({{ 'assets/images/github-repo-checkup-list.jpg' | relative_url }})

In case it's not there they normally indicate the word add in the small box normally at the right hand side,just click the add in the small box on th right hand side and select the license of your choice.
