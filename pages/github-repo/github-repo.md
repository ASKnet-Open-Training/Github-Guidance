# Github Repository

You can compare a repository to a folder where you can store additional subfolders and files. You can give your repository (like a folder) a name. Additionally you can add a description and upload a repository image.
A repository can be public or private and only accessible to certain people. You decide who can see your content.

The big difference to a simple folder (local or online) is that a repository remembers every change. When a change was made and who changed it. In addition, the differences between the various work statuses can be seen quite clearly.
