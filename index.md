## Introduction

This guide is meant to introduce you to Github as easily as possible. By the way, this guide is also based on a Github repository ;)

### Contributors
If you don't find what you're looking for, feel free to [create an issue]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/issues/new) and we'll expand the guide.

### Developer
If you would like to help extending the guide, feel free to fork [the repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}) and send us a pull request.

## First of all: What is Github?

Github is a platform where you can document your ideas/projects and share the knowledge with others. Also, the Github provides a task management where you can collect and distribute your tasks.

The content (text, images, PDF or other file types) is stored in a [repository](pages/github-repo). The technology behind this is called [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). Everything that is stored in a repository is also automatically versioned. Saving a file is called [commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)). Git remembers every commit and it is very easy to track what has been changed since the last commit or commits.

## Getting started

This guide is divided into four main parts:
- [Account](pages/github-account)
- [Repository](pages/github-repo)
- [Issues](pages/github-issues)
- [Markdown](pages/github-markdown)
