By the way, this guide is also based on a Github repository ;) ### Contributors If you don't find what you're looking for, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/ASKnet-Open-Training/Github-Guidance/issues/new) and we'll expand the guide. ### Developer If you would like to help extending the guide, feel free to fork [the repository](https://github.com/ASKnet-Open-Training/Github-Guidance) and send us a pull request. ## First of all: What is Github? Github is a platform where you can document your ideas, projects and share the knowledge with others. Also, the Github provides a task management where you can collect and distribute your tasks. The content (text, images, PDF or other file types) is stored in a [repository](pages/github-repo). The technology behind this is called [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). Everything that is stored in a repository is also automatically versioned. Saving a file is called [commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)). Git remembers every commit and it is very easy to track what has been changed since the last commit or commits. ## Getting started This guide is divided into three main parts: - [Account](pages/github-account) - [Repository](pages/github-repo) - [Issues](pages/github-issues) - [Markdown](pages/github-markdown) You can select one of the main points and then you will find more sub-points on the topic. On the left side you can see an overview of all topics covered in the guide. You can also use the search that you will find at the top center: \"Search Github-Guidance\". ## License This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
